# Calculate GPA-CGPA
As a college student, itâ€™s essential to keep track of your academic performance,  
and one of the key metrics used to measure your progress is your Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).  
    
Calculating CGPA can be time-consuming and complex, especially if you have taken multiple courses  
with varying credit loads and grading systems. However, with the help of a CGPA calculator,  
the process can be much more straightforward and efficient.    
    --------------- Method of Calculating GPA & CGPA ----------------  
           GPA= Sum of (Credit*Point) / total of credits    
              CGPA=  Sum of GPA / number of semesters
